# the-wiring-faults
the wiring faults existed commonly in the LVDS(low-votage distribution system), we discovery that the load current of anomaly user with wiring fault will cause a drasmatic change of residual cuurent in LVDS. So, it is possiable to analyze their correlation between residual current of LVDS and load current of users
